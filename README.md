<strong>The AlBayan Library</strong> is a successful book rental service with branches in Ramallah, Amman, and Dubai. It employs around 200 staff members and serves approximately 20,000 registered members. The library uses a comprehensive database system to manage member registration, staff records, book inventory, rentals, and feedback.

Members can rent up to five books from any branch, and late fines apply for overdue books. Members can also provide book feedback with ratings and optional comments. Encryption techniques using symmetric keys and certificates are applied to protect sensitive member data.

The project aims to streamline operations, enhance customer experiences, and efficiently manage resources across all branches, ensuring a convenient and enriching experience for members.
